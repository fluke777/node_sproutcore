This is a simple Sproutcore project, that is using a long polling comet server written in NodeJS. It is supposed to accompany the article published on http://svarovsky-tomas.com/nodejs-sproutcore.html

NodeJS server can be found in node_server directory

Thanks to mkroehnert, who kindly updated this code to work with latest node 0.1.91
